## Post-Drawing Robot

![](../Media/Gifs/DrawBotV2.gif)

This is an example application of MarIOnette. [Follow along with a video tutorial from here](https://www.youtube.com)

Print out the parts in the STL folder. I used the following settings:
Material: PLA
0.20mm Layer Height
3 Outer Perimeters
4 Top and Bottom Layers
25% Gyroid Infill
